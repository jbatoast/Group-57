2. **Dataset-Group 57**: A CSV file containing the tweets used in the project.
3. **install_dependencies.sh**: A script to install all of the libraries needed to run the notebooks and twitter scraper. Requires Python 3 to be installed.
4. **LDA.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook used to perform Linear Dirichlet Allocation analysis on the dataset and generate the interactive topic exploration applet in the portfolio website.
5. **results/ldavis_prepared_5final-final5.html**: An applet generated by **LDA.ipynb** showing the top 30 non-search topics across 5 groups of tweets. Larger circles indicate more tweets in a group.
6. **Tweet_Harvester.py**: A tweet scraper program used to scrape the relevant tweets from Twitter via snscrape. Includes an option to re-fetch the tweets used in the study. Note that some tweets and accounts may have been taken down or rendered inaccessible as of now.
