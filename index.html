						<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
						<p>One of the various forms of disinformation regarding the Marcos family that is being circulated is that the Marcoses won all of the cases that were filed against them, especially those partaining to stolen or ill-gotten wealth. This claim has been proven false by fact-checking organizations and court rulings confirming that several cases ended with the Marcos family being guilty of multiple instances of graft and corruption, and several million dollars worth of assets being repossessed by the government. Despite this, the claim circulated in social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter.</p>
						<h2>Our research aims to analyze how the narrative that the Marcos family won all cases filed against them disseminated on Twitter.</h2>
						<p>We believe that the results of this study will help in identifying patterns and trends common to misinformation centered around the Marcos family, especially in the context of historical revisionism with the aim of improving the image of the Marcoses and the administration of Ferdinand Marcos Sr. in the eyes of the Filipino public.</p>

							<p>The first test revealed a negative correlation for posts claiming the Marcoses won all of their cases and mentions of the Aquino family or the Liberal Party. This result is the opposite of our original prediction, but since the chi-squared value is greater than the critical value, and the p-value is very small, we can safely reject our null hypothesis that there is no relation between the tweets claiming that the Marcoses won all of their cases and the tweets mentioning the Aquinos, Liberal Party, or their supporters. One possible reason for this is that misinformation tweets aimed at people who are already biased in favor of the Marcos family or are neutral towards them would already have an idea of who the "opposition" is based on other misinformation or propaganda posts. As a result, mentioning a specific enemy such as the Aquino family would be unnecessary unless the goal is to provoke a response from the opposition or to convince non-supporters to agree to their theories.</p>

							<h2>Second Test - Relation between tweets and campaign period</h2>
							<p>For this test, the null hypothesis assumes that tweets claiming that the Marcoses won all their cases are equally likely to appear regardless of what month or year it is. The expected distributions were taken by multiplying the total number of tweets with the number of months in the interval divided by the total number of months in the observation period of 2016-2022, rounded to the nearest integer.</p>

							<p> The second test revealed a strong positive correlation between the posts claiming the Marcoses won all of their cases and the timing of Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s presidential campaign in 2022. Since the chi-squared value is much greater than the critical value, and the p-value is very small, we can safely reject our null hypothesis that there is no relation between the tweets claiming that the Marcoses won all of their cases and the tweets taking place during the 2022 election campaign period of Bongbong Marcos. Rather, the data suggests that the Marcos campaign directly led to a surge in these tweets, mainly by Bongbong Marcos supporters as indicated by the activity of many of the users that posted these tweets, as well as troll accounts as indicated by the high proportion of users that posted these tweets within a year of joining.</p>

							<h2>Topic Classification</h2>
							<p>The five groups (with an example tweet) are as follows:.</p>
							<hr class="hr">
								<p><strong>1. </strong>The Marcoses were cleared in court of their cases with Imelda Marcos'es victory in the Trial of the Century in New York.</p>
								<p><img src="images/tweet1b.png" alt="image of one of the misinformation tweets" title="Since the 90s the Marcoses were cleared of all charges in the fraud case in the U.S Court, the Trial Court of the Century, they won there, this Aquino can't accept that, so when he came to the Philippines, ton of cases were filed against the Marcoses accusing them of ill gotten wealth."></p>
								<hr class="hr">
								<p><strong>2. </strong>The Sandiganbayan and Philippine Courts were not able to prove after so many years that the Marcos wealth was ill-gotten or that the Marcoses were theives.</p>
								<p><img src="images/tweet2b.png" alt="image of one of the misinformation tweets" title="Been over 30 years now & it hasn't been proven there is ill-gotten wealth. Sandiganbayan & Supreme Court have junked all cases against Marcoses. Why were there no incarcerated Marcoses if the allegations were indeed true? Dumb, stupid, jerk. you keep rambling about imagined stolen wealth."></p>
								<hr class="hr">
								<p><strong>3. </strong>The Aquinos still have no proof that the Marcoses stole from the people after so many years, if anything the Aquinos were the real theives who stole the Marcos family's hard-earned wealth.</p>
								<p><img src="images/tweet3b.png" alt="image of one of the misinformation tweets" title="What did the Marcoses steal? They the Cory Aquino government filed 935 cases against the Marcos not guilty to all of them .... 30 years has passed - not guilty nothing was proven... INSTEAD THE AQUINOS WERE THE ONES WHO STOLE FROM THE MARCOSES !! The Aquinos are the real thieves with evidence!"></p>
								<hr class="hr">
								<p><strong>4. </strong>There is no evidence that the Marcoses are guilty of anything, as shown in the New York trial, and all the accusations against them are baseless conjecture.</p>
								<p><img src="images/tweet4b.png" alt="image of one of the misinformation tweets" title="Be careful Pang. Have you heard of Cyber Libel? You can't accuse anyone without evidence. Let the courts decide. All these Marcos wealth are unproven without evidence. New York courts acquitted the Marcoses. All allegations against them were fake news by CIA."></p>
								<hr class="hr">
								<p><strong>5. </strong>The courts and the Philippine Commision on Good Governance had no evidence against the Marcoses, so they deserve to have their stolen wealth returned to them.</p>
								<p><img src="images/tweet5b.png" alt="image of one of the misinformation tweets" title="PCGG Where are the sequestered assets, Jewelries, etc...Marcos cleared all the cases 996 cases here & abroad The Trials of the Century not guilty that Andress Bautista chairman ng PCGG the amount of pilfered assets by PCGG is astonishing according to his wife"></p>
								<hr class="hr">
						</header>
						<p>In all of these groups, the common argument is that because the Marcos family, more specifically Imelda Marcos, won so many high-profile cases, they are automatically cleared of all charges. This is a flawed argument, since these victories do not invalidate the multiple lost cases that the Marcoses incurred over the years. From a political perspective, the goal of some of these posts is not just to prove the innocence of the Marcos family, but to also portray their opposition as corrupt and villainous.</p>
						<p>It should be emphaized that these tweets are part of a movement to distort Philippine history through false claims and portray the administration of Ferdinand Marcos Sr. as a "golden age" without the corruption, human rights violations, and criminal charges that have happened and have been repeatedly verified to have happened in reality. While misinformation is not strictly tied to the Marcos administrations and may even be used by opposing parties, it remains a prominent and frequently-used tool to gain favor from the masses. Identifying and immediately addressing these blatant falsehoods, especially when they are promoted by those in positions of power and influence, will be essential to upholding truth and democracy in Philippine society.</p>

					<header>
						<h1>Conclusion and Recommendations</h1>
						<ul>
							<li>There is enough evidence to suggest a link between Twitter posts claiming that the Marcos family won all cases that were filed against them and an explicit reference to the Aquino family, the Liberal Party or either of their supporters. However, the users were less likely to mention the Aquinos or Liberal Party, rather than more likely as initially predicted.</li>
							<li>There is also evidence suggesting that the 2022 presidential campaign of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. influenced a spike in tweets spreading this misinformation on Twitter.</li>
							<li>Further research can explore the relation between misinformation posts on social media related to the Marcos family or the Marcos administration, and the timing of these posts with high-profile events such as elections and the passing of controversial policies.</li>
							<li>We should be critical about posts and claims made on social media and conduct research and validation before even considering sharing these claims with others, even when these claims support our biases and political agendas.</li>

								<p>Our group chose the topic of the misinformation that the Marcos family won all of the cases filed against them for our project as this claim represents the dangers of unchecked misinformation on the internet and social media, as well as the ulterior goals of pro-Marcos disinformation movements to clear them of the atrocities and rampant corruption of the Martial Law era. It also highlights the binary absolutism and radicalization that these forms of misinformation promote, in this case the premise that the Marcoses and their allied politicians are righteous and completely innocent while the "Dilawan" liberal politicians and their supporters are corrupt or foolish for opposing the Marcoses.</p>
