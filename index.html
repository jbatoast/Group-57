							<h2>Immoral Support</h2>

							<p>Tweets that were posted during the Presidential campaign period of Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. from his candidacy filing on October 2021 to the election on May 2022. This raises the possibility that a number of these tweets were politically motivated with the goal of raising support for Marcos during his campaign.</p>

							<p>The first test revealed a negative correlation for posts claiming the Marcoses won all of their cases and mentions of the Aquino family or the Liberal Party. One possible reason for this is that misinformation tweets aimed at people who are already biased in favor of the Marcos family or are neutral towards them would already have an idea of who the "opposition" is based on other misinformation or propaganda posts. As a result, mentioning a specific enemy such as the Aquino family would be unnecessary unless the goal is to provoke a response from the opposition.</p>

							<p> The second test revealed a strong positive correlation between the posts claiming the Marcoses won all of their cases and the timing of Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s presidential campaign in 2022. This implies that the campaign led to a surge in these tweets, mainly by Bongbong Marcos supporters as indicated by the activity of many of the users that posted these tweets, as well as troll accounts as indicated by the high proportion of users that posted these tweets within a year of joining.</p>

							<h2>Topic Analysis</h2>
							<p>The wordmap showing the most prevalent keywords in the tweets is shown below. Unsurprisingly, several search terms such as "Marcos", "won", and "cases" are the most common.</p>

							<h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation</h2>
							<p>The topics were clustered into 5 groups. The applet shows the most relevant terms found in each group.</p>

						<header>
							<h2>Topic Classification</h2>
							<p>The five groups (with an example tweet) are as follows:.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>1. </strong>The Marcoses were cleared in court of their cases with Imelda Marcos'es victory in the Trial of the Century in New York.</li>
								<li><img src="images/tweet1b.png" alt="image of one of the misinformation tweets"></li>
								<li><strong>2. </strong>The Sandiganbayan and Philippine Courts were not able to prove after so many years that the Marcos wealth was ill-gotten or that the Marcoses were theives.</li>
								<li><img src="images/tweet2b.png" alt="image of one of the misinformation tweets"></li>
								<li><strong>3. </strong>The Aquinos still have no proof that the Marcoses stole from the people after so many years, if anything the Aquinos were the real theives who stole the Marcos family's hard-earned wealth.</li>
								<li><img src="images/tweet3b.png" alt="image of one of the misinformation tweets"></li>
								<li><strong>4. </strong>There is no evidence that the Marcoses are guilty of anything, as shown in the New York trial, and all the accusations against them are baseless conjecture.</li>
								<li><img src="images/tweet4b.png" alt="image of one of the misinformation tweets"></li>
								<li><strong>5. </strong>The courts and the Philippine Commision on Good Governance had no evidence against the Marcoses, so they deserve to have their stolen wealth returned to them.</li>
								<li><img src="images/tweet5b.png" alt="image of one of the misinformation tweets"></li>
							</ul>
						</header>
						<p>In all of these groups, the common argument is that because the Marcos family, more specifically Imelda Marcos, won so many high-profile cases, they are automatically cleared of all charges. This is a flawed argument, since these victories do not invalidate the multiple lost cases that the Marcoses incurred over the years.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<header>
							<h2>Conclusion and Recommendations</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>There is enough evidence to suggest a link between Twitter posts claiming that the Marcos family won all cases that were filed against them and an explicit reference to the Aquino family, the Liberal Party or either of their supporters. However, the users were less likely to mention the Aquinos or Liberal Party, rather than more likely as initially predicted.</li>
								<li>There is also evidence suggesting that the 2022 presidential campaign of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. influenced a spike in tweets spreading this misinformation on Twitter.</li>
								<li>Further research can explore the relation between misinformation posts on social media related to the Marcos family or the Marcos administration, and the timing of these posts with high-profile events such as elections and the passing of controversial policies.</li>
