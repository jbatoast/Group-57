							<h2>Immoral Support</h2>
							<img src="images/immoral.png">
							<p>Tweets that were posted during the Presidential campaign period of Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. from his candidacy filing on October 2021 to the election on May 2022. This raises the possibility that a number of these tweets were politically motivated with the goal of raising support for Marcos during his campaign.</p>

							<h2>The Aquino Connection</h2>
							<img src="images/aquino.png">
							<p>Tweets that explicitly mention the Cory Aquino administration, the Aquino family, or members of the Liberal Party of the Philippines and their supporters. The Aquinos and the Liberal Party served as political opponents of Ferdinand Marcos Sr. and Bongbong Marcos respectively.</p>

							<h2>Historical Revisionism</h2>
							<img src="images/historical.png">
							<p>Tweets mentioning the Aquinos or Liberal Party that portray them negatively using slurs or with accusations of corruption, plundering the national treasury, and conspiracy with the US government. These tweets support a narrative where the Marcos family was innocent of the accusations levied against them by a "villainous" Aquino administration.</p>

							<p>Χ-stat: 25.62; p_val: 4.15e-7 -> REJECT</p>
							<p>The first test revealed a negative correlation for posts claiming the Marcoses won all of their cases and mentions of the Aquino family or the Liberal Party. One possible reason for this is that misinformation tweets aimed at people who are already biased in favor of the Marcos family or are neutral towards them would already have an idea of who the "opposition" is based on other misinformation or propaganda posts. As a result, mentioning a specific enemy such as the Aquino family would be unnecessary unless the goal is to provoke a response from the opposition.</p>

							</table>
							<p>Χ-stat: 522.21; p_val: 1.40e-115 -> REJECT</p>
							<p> The second test revealed a strong positive correlation between the posts claiming the Marcoses won all of their cases and the timing of Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s presidential campaign in 2022. This implies that the campaign led to a surge in these tweets, mainly by Bongbong Marcos supporters as indicated by the activity of many of the users that posted these tweets, as well as troll accounts as indicated by the high proportion of users that posted these tweets within a year of joining.</p>

							<h2>Conclusion and Recommendations</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>There is enough evidence to suggest a link between Twitter posts claiming that the Marcos family won all cases that were filed against them and an explicit reference to the Aquino family, the Liberal Party or either of their supporters. However, the users were less likely to mention the Aquinos or Liberal Party, rather than more likely as initially predicted.</li>
								<li>There is also evidence suggesting that the 2022 presidential campaign of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. influenced a spike in tweets spreading this misinformation on Twitter.</li>
								<li>Further research can explore the relation between misinformation posts on social media related to the Marcos family or the Marcos administration, and the timing of these posts with high-profile events such as elections and the passing of controversial policies.</li>
